# Arkouda Distance

Client only implementation of distance calculations.

## Methods Implemented
- `dot()` compute the dot product of 2 pdarrays.
- `magnitude()` compute the magnitude/L2-Norm of a pdarray.
- `consine()` compute the cosine distance of 2 pdarrays.
- `euclidean()` compute the Euclidean distance of 2 pdarrays.
